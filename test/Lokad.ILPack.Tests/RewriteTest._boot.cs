     * These test cases work by taking the TestSubject project, passing it
     * through ILPack to generate a new assembly and then checking that the
     * newly generated assembly is correct by actually loading it and invoking
     * methods and properties on it.
     * 
     * It works as follows:
     * 
     * 1. `TestSubject.dll` is loaded through a project reference and found
     *    with a simple typeof(MyClass)
     *        
     * 2. ILPack is used to to rewrite a new assembly `ClonedTestSubject.dll`
     * 
     * 3. To allow the second DLL to be loaded into the same process (we don't
     *    have AppDomains under net core), we use ILPack's RenameForTesting method
     *    to change the names of the assembly and the contained namespace(s)
     *    
     * 4. Use CSharpScript to load the newly cloned assembly and poke it in 
     *    various ways to make sure it still works.
     *    
     * Also, in the Lokad.ILPack.Tests project folder there's a dump.bat script
     * which on Windows will run ildasm and mddumper on both the original and the
     * cloned assemblies.  Handy for comparison when diagnosing issues. (ildasm
     * and mddumper both need to be on your path)
